# Overview
This website collects all the documents developers need when embedding Vpon Data Software Development Kit (Data SDK), including the [integration process](http://datasdk-developer.vpon.com/integration_process), implementation guides, and requirements for Android and iOS mobile Apps. Sample codes are also provided for the developer's reference. Visit our [official website][1] for the relevant information if you have business-side queries.

The general workflow of Data SDK includes three steps.
* Trigger events by user's actions, such as App launch. 
  * See [Auto Events](http://datasdk-developer.vpon.com/auto_events) and Customized Events ([iOS](http://datasdk-developer.vpon.com/ios#set-up-customized-events), [Android](http://datasdk-developer.vpon.com/android#set-up-customized-events) for more details.
* Collect device-based data. 
  * See [Data Collection](https://datasdk.vpon.com/introduction/data-collection) for more information.
* Send data to the server after encryption. 
  *  The data is ready for further application.
