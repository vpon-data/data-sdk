# Overview
This website collects all the documents developers need when embedding Vpon Data Software Development Kit (Data SDK), including the [Integration Process]({% link docs/IntegrationProcess.md %}) implementation guides, and requirements for Android and iOS mobile Apps. Sample codes are also provided for the developer's reference. Visit our [official website][1] for the relevant information if you have business-side queries.

The general workflow of Data SDK includes three steps.
* Trigger events by user's actions, such as App launch. 
  * See [Auto Events]({% link docs/AutoEvents.md %}) and Customized Events ([iOS](%link /docs/iOS.md %)#set-up-customized-events, [Android](% link docs/Android.md#set-up-customized-events %)) for more details.
* Collect device-based data. 
  * See [Data Collection](https://datasdk.vpon.com/introduction/data-collection) for more information.
* Send data to the server after encryption. 
  *  The data is ready for further application.
