Vpon Data Software Development Kit (Data SDK) is a light data collection toolkit to help you understand your App users' behaviors and insights.

Data SDK implements App data collection based on iOS and android APIs. The data will be collected when some particular App events occur or trigger. The triggerd event type setup is flexible according to your App design. You can leverage Data SDK to understand your App users more without worrying any complex API definitions, iterations, and other details. 

With Data SDK integration into your App, your users' data with the authorization will be collected properly and securely. You can explore more business opportunities via dashboards, includs but not limited to Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tagging.
