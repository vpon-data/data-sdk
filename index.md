# Overview
Vpon Data Software Development Kit (Data SDK) is a light data collection toolkit to help you understand your App users' behaviors and insights. You can leverage Data SDK to understand your App users more without worrying about any complex App API definitions, iterations, and other details.

Data SDK implements App data collection based on iOS and Android APIs. The data will be collected when some particular App events occur or trigger. The occurred or triggered event type setup is flexible according to your App design and business requirements. Finally, the user behavioral info is stored in your DB hosted by Vpon.
